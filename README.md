# to-do-list
### Q1:What did you learn while making this app?
While making this app, I learned how to  implement a background image that improve the overall design. This is my second to-do list project — in my first one, I didn’t include images. This time, I explored how to add images, style elements differently, create buttons, and use JavaScript more effectively than in my previous task.
### Q2:What feature did you enjoy building the most?
Adding background image ,finding reference images in different websites

### Q3:What would you add next if you had more time?
If I had more time, I would add additional tools to enhance the to-do list experience. For example, I’d include a  alarm clock to help users manage their time and stay on schedule,it useful for studying or task-based planning. I’d also add a feature to take and save output screenshots of completed tasks or progress, so users can visually track their improvement over time and stay motivated and aware about their works.
